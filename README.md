# 📦 [PROJECT TITLE]

> *A succinct, one-sentence description of the project and its primary goal.*

## 🚀 Overview

This project focuses on **[Mention the core business objective, e.g., optimizing inventory levels, predicting shipment delays, or analyzing supplier performance]** within a simulated supply chain environment.

Utilizing **[Mention the core programming language/tool, e.g., Python/R]** and advanced analytical techniques, the goal was to derive actionable insights that could lead to **[Mention the key benefit, e.g., cost savings, improved delivery times, or reduced stockouts]**.

## Data Overview

Provide a description of the data here and a sample. The datafile was called `transactions.csv`

| Skus  | Qty |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| left foo      | 1     |
| left bar      | 2     |
| left baz      | 3     |

## 📊 Key Features & Deliverables

* **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Sourced and processed raw data on **[e.g., historical orders, transportation logs, warehouse movements]**. Handled missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.
* **[Specific Analytical Technique]:** Developed a **[e.g., Monte Carlo Simulation, Time Series Forecast (ARIMA/Prophet), or Classification Model]** to predict/model **[target variable]**.
* **KPI Dashboard:** Created an interactive dashboard using **[e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Streamlit]** to visualize critical Supply Chain KPIs, such as **[e.g., Perfect Order Rate, Inventory Turnover Ratio, On-Time Delivery]**.
* **Optimization/Recommendation Engine:** Provided a final set of data-driven recommendations that project a **[e.g., 15% reduction in carrying costs]**.

## 🖼️ Visual Showcase
